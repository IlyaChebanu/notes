# Artificial Inteligence with Python


### Supervised learning

Building a machine learning model that is based on labeled training data.

### Unsupervised learning

Building a model that does not rely on labeled training data.


### Classification

A classification model assigns a class to a new piece of data based on the patterns observed in the training dataset. eg. *Hot dog / Not hot dog*

A good classification model makes it easy to find and retrieve data.

We need to provide a large enough number of samples as training data for the algorithm to generalise the problem.
If there is an insufficient number of samples, then the algorithm will **overfit** to the training data, meaning it won't perform well on unknown data because it fine tuned itself to the patterns found in the training data.


### Preprocessing

In order to prepare the raw data to be used for training it must first be preprocessed into the right format for the model.
Preprocessing techniques include:
- Binarization
- Mean removal
- Scaling
- Normalization
